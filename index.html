            <h1>Project Information</h1>
            <p>
                The idea for this project is to explore popular recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures and their efficacy in
                creating accurate regressions on time series financial data (Stocks, Cryptocurrencies, Bonds, etc). RNNs are used on a wide variety of 
                problem sets including: autonomous driving, speech recognition/generation, and others.
                The use cases of RNNs, faced paced nature of the field, and a desire to continue learning about the field are the primary drivers for my interest in
                this topic.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Dataset Details</h3>
            <p>
                The dataset will include normalized price and volume data from a variety of sources to cover different financial markets.
                I plan to use open-source datasets such as those available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com"><u>kaggle.com</u></a> which include a variety of historical prices
                and other relevant data for a variety of financial instruments. These datasets are large enough to be sufficient in 
                evaluating the performance of each architecture against its peers.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Software Used</h3>
            <p>
                I plan to use a variety of software to create and/or replicate popular RNN architectures. 
                The most important technologies are listed below:
            </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Python 3.x</li>
                    <li>TensorFlow 2.x</li>
                    <li>Keras 2.3.x</li>
                    <li>Numpy 1.x</li>

            <h3>Relevant Papers</h3>
            <p>
                I plan to take a holistic approach to learning about RNNs. This will include reading both early and modern papers on
                the topic so that I am able to better understand: RNN use cases, early machine learning approaches to solving time series regressions,
                and the modern advances to RNN architectures applicable to my problem set. Initially I plan to read the following papers:

            <h3>Teammate Status</h3>
            <p>I will not have a teammate for this project.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Progress milestones</h3>
            <p>This project will have two milestones: the progress date (April 14, 2020) and the final due date (May 12, 2020).</p>

            <h4><u>Progress Due Date</u></h4>
            <p>I hope to have the following finished by this date:</p>
