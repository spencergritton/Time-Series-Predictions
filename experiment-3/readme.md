# Experiment 3 Overview
The purpose of this experiment is to see how each of these networks can do when training to their full potential. The following changes were made to experiment 2 to allow for this.
- Deeper networks
- 1,000 epoch training (~6 Hours per network)
- 1,000,000 minutes of total data (~15X more than experiment 2)

# Experiment issues
There were several large issues with this experiment
- Attempting to use the experiment 2 data-generator.py on a 1,000,000 row csv file was **extremely** slow. The program ran for 27 hours on my mac and then crashed when saving the dataset pickle file. Because of this I was forced to learn more about pandas and pickle to solve this issue.
- Loading the dataset into memory was impossible on many machines. This was solved by renting a computer with more memory.

# To Run the Experiments
The files in experiment-3 rely on a pre-built dataset in the form of a pickle file generated by *experiment-3/data-generator.py*.

The data-generator if ran unchanged will generate the file: *coinbase.pickle*. This file is generated from the 1,000,000 row file: *data/coinbase.csv*

So to run any of these experiments do the following (from the main project folder):
1. Generate the dataset 
> python3 experiment-3/data-generator.py
2. Run your choice of experiment
> python3 experiment-3/filename.py

**NOTE: The dataset for this experiment is around 10GB and will take about 1-5 minutes to generate depending on CPU.**
**NOTE 2: Loading the dataset into python memory requires > 10GB of RAM. If your computer does not have this the program will crash. Additionally, if your GPU has low memory you may have to reduce the batch size of each file.**

# Logs
Each file is logged using tensorboard to the experiment-2/logs folder. 
Take a look at TensorBoard's documentation for help viewing them: https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard

# Checkpoints
The best Keras for each architecture is saved in the experiment-3/checkpoints folder.
Take a look at this documentation to see how to load the models: https://keras.io/getting_started/faq/

# Plots
A .PNG graph of each architecture's training process is saved in the experiment-3/plots folder. Check them out if you're curious.

# ml-results.csv
This file tracks a lot of stats about each network. It's stored at: experiment-3/ml-results.csv. Check it out if you're interested.
