# Introduction
Welcome to my final project for CS:5980:002 Deep Learning at the University of Iowa.
This project consists of three experiments testing the results of using different RNN cell types
in financial time series regressions. These experiments are by no means exhaustive as compute time is quite expensive and time consuming. Nevertheless, I found these experiments to be quite enjoyable and informative for my own learning. I hope you will too.

# Dependencies
